    <h1>Hey there, I'm Sara! ðŸ‘‹ </h1><br><br>
    <p>Originally, I come from Seattle but I'm currently based in Amsterdam. Over the last 8 years Iâ€™ve accumulated a range of skills as a multidisciplinary designer and worked on products in the both the B2B and B2C space. The projects that get me most excited are ones where I get to dabble in the whole process from research all the way through to toasting champaign after launch! I love to create solutions that solve user problems that ultimatly bring the business and our users closer together.
